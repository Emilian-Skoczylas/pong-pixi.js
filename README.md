# Pong Clone - HTML5 Game with Pixi.js
This project is a simple clone of the classic **1972 Pong arcade game**, built using **Pixi.js** and **Howler.js** for sound effects.

The goal of this project was to solidify my knowledge of Pixi.js through a full implementation of an HTML5 game, with focus on optimizing game loop performance, precise collision handling, and seamless audio integration.

# Live Demo
You can play play the game [here](https://emilian-skoczylas.github.io/pong-pixi.js/).

# About the Original Pong (1972)
Pong was one of the very first commercially successful video games, originally released by **Atari** in 1972. The gameplay is a simulation of table tennis, where two players control paddles and attempt to bounce a ball past the opponent to score points.

The mechanics were extremely simple — two vertical paddles, a ball bouncing within the screen, and a score counter — but it laid the foundation for modern video games and game design.

# Features
- Two-player gameplay with paddle control (`W`/`S` and Arrow keys)
- Increasing ball speed for more dynamic gameplay
- Dynamic bounce angle depending on collision point on the paddle
- Sound effects: paddle hit, wall bounce, scoring a point
- Game win condition (first to 11 points)
- Restart functionality (`R` key)
- Responsive layout prepared for GitHub Pages
- Clean modular code (separate classes for Ball, Paddle, Sfx, and Game logic)

# Technologies Used
